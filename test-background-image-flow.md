# Background Image Upload Test Summary

## What was fixed:

### 1. Backend - Bio Customization Endpoint
- Updated `/api/bio/customization` endpoint to include `backgroundType` and `backgroundImage` fields
- These fields are now properly saved to the database

### 2. Frontend - Auto-save Functionality
- Modified `VisualBioBuilder.jsx` to automatically save customization changes when theme is updated
- When a background image is uploaded, it now:
  - Uploads the image to the server
  - Updates local state immediately for instant preview
  - Saves the customization to the backend

### 3. Frontend - Opacity Fix
- Fixed opacity issue in both `PublicBioPage.jsx` and `PreviewContent.jsx`
- Background images now use a separate layer so opacity only affects the image, not the content
- Text and buttons remain fully visible regardless of background opacity setting

## How the flow works now:

1. **Upload**: User selects background image in Properties Panel
2. **Process**: Image is uploaded to server via `/api/upload/file`
3. **Update**: Theme is updated with image URL and default settings
4. **Save**: Customization is automatically saved to backend
5. **Display**: Background image renders correctly in both preview and public page

## Test Instructions:

1. Go to Bio Builder page
2. Select "Page Design" in Properties Panel
3. Choose "Image" as Background Type
4. Upload an image (< 5MB)
5. Adjust opacity, blur, and other settings
6. Check that changes appear in preview
7. Visit public bio page to verify background displays correctly
